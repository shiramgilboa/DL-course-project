## Project Content
- Dataset - COVID-19 patient's symptoms, status, and medical history
- Data Pre-Processing and Sampling Techniques
- XGBoost and simple FC neural network
- TabNet - deep learning architecture designed by Google to affectively apply deep learning on tabular data
- Additional method for improving results
- Results Comparison

---

## Repository Content
- Two helpers files:
  1. models_helpers.py
  2. pre_proccessing_helpers.py
- Data pre-processing notebook ("data_pre_precossing.ipynb")
- TabNet, XGBoost and FC neural network results notebook ("models.ipynb")
- RTDL results notebook **********
- XGBoost optimization notebook ("xgboost_optimizing.ipynb")
---

## How to Use
- First install TabNet to your work environment - "pip install pytorch-tabnet" 
- Create a folder for all the code files, inside it create another folder named 'data'
- Download dataset from link bellow 
- In data pre-processing notebook, delete '#' from last row in last block and run the code
- Run models.ipynb and ******* to get results

note:
XGBoost optimization notebook was used to optimize XGBoost paremeters (for comparison with the DL models) and does not need to be run again.
